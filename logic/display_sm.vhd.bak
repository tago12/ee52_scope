--  SoPC Oscilloscope VRAM Controller
--
--  Implementation of the VRAM Controller for the SoPC Oscilloscope project.
--  The state machine generates the necessary timing signals for the VRAM
--  based on the needs of the CPU and display controller. Additionally,
--  it refreshes the VRAM as necessary.
--  The inputs to the system determine what action needs to be performed:
--  cs+we requests a read or a write, while ureq requests a SAM row update.
--  The system then outputs the necessary timing signals, and a rdy/uack
--  signal to notify the sender of the end of the cycle.
--  The state machine is implemented using a Moore state machine and a state
--  assignment architecture.
